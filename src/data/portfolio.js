         I am building a route planning application aimed at cyclists for my dissertation project at university.
         The application is built using Go, React and Vite utilising OpenRouteService, Leaflet and OpenWeatherMap
         as well as including a hazard index, database and reporting system. I have also integrated the route planner
         with external fitness services such as Strava and Garmin Connect. The code will be made public after I
         have graduated.

       I have recently built this portfolio website using React, Vite and TailwindCSS.
       The plan was to simplify my portfolio, making it more accessible, with less redundant information.
       All the code is viewable on my GitHub.
