         I am building a route planning application aimed at cyclists for my dissertation project at university.
         The application is built using Go, React and Vite utilising OpenRouteService, Leaflet and OpenWeatherMap
         as well as including a hazard index, database and reporting system. I have also integrated the route planner
         with external fitness services such as Strava and Garmin Connect. The code will be made public after I
         have graduated.

       Throughout the Year 2 Application Engineering Module, I developed a LegoÂ© E-commerce store featuring account management, 
       a basket system, order fulfillment processes, and a product catalog, all accessible via a web browser on port 8080. Utilising Auth0, 
       I implemented OAuth authentication to ensure secure handling of user accounts without storing passwords locally. The project culminated 
       in a high first grade of 77, and the complete source code is available for review.
